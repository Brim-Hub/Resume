Here’s your content cleaned up and formatted properly as a **ready-to-copy README.md** file. You can save it directly as `README.md` in your project root:

# My Portfolio App

This is a personal portfolio web application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It showcases my technical skills, projects, and experience in a clean, modern, and interactive interface.

---

## Features

- Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Animated UI using **Framer Motion**
- Skills section with dynamic icons and hover effects
- Projects and experience sections
- Contact links integrated using environment variables
- Built with **MERN Stack** technologies

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

# Demo Environment Variables for Portfolio App

VITE_USER_NAME=John Doe
VITE_USER_EMAIL=johndoe@example.com
VITE_USER_WHATSAPP=https://wa.me/1234567890?text=Hello!%20I%20saw%20your%20portfolio%20and%20want%20to%20connect.
VITE_USER_LINKEDIN=https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe
VITE_USER_GITHUB=https://github.com/johndoe

````

> **Note:** The `VITE_` prefix is required for Vite to expose environment variables to your React app.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brim-Hub/my-portfolio-app.git
cd my-portfolio-app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Add your `.env` file as shown above.

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the app at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is occupied).

```

This version fixes:

- Markdown headings and code blocks
- Proper section separation
- Correctly formatted instructions for cloning, installing, and running  

If you want, I can also **add sections for project structure, scripts, and contact info**, so it’s a full professional README for GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that?
```
